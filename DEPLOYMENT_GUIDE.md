# ðŸš€ Deployment Guide - QR Code Menu App

## Problem Solved âœ…
Fixed the **404 NOT FOUND** error when scanning QR codes in production by configuring proper SPA (Single Page Application) routing.

## Files Added/Modified
- `public/_redirects` - Netlify configuration
- `vercel.json` - Vercel configuration  
- `public/404.html` - GitHub Pages fallback
- `index.html` - Added GitHub Pages SPA support script
- `dist/.htaccess` - Apache server configuration
- `vite.config.ts` - Enhanced build configuration

## Deployment Instructions by Platform

### ðŸ”µ **Netlify** (Recommended)
1. Build your app: `npm run build`
2. Deploy the `dist` folder to Netlify
3. The `public/_redirects` file will automatically handle SPA routing
4. âœ… QR codes will work immediately!

### ðŸŸ¢ **Vercel**
1. Build your app: `npm run build`  
2. Deploy to Vercel
3. The `vercel.json` file will handle the routing
4. âœ… QR codes will work immediately!

### ðŸŸ¡ **GitHub Pages**
1. Build your app: `npm run build`
2. Deploy the `dist` folder to GitHub Pages
3. The `public/404.html` and modified `index.html` handle routing
4. âœ… QR codes will work immediately!

### ðŸŸ  **Apache Server**
1. Build your app: `npm run build`
2. Upload `dist` folder contents to your Apache server
3. The `.htaccess` file will handle routing
4. âœ… QR codes will work immediately!

### ðŸ”´ **Other Hosting**
If using a different hosting service, ensure it's configured to:
- Serve `index.html` for all routes that don't match static files
- Support client-side routing for SPAs

## How It Works
When someone scans the QR code:
1. They visit `yoursite.com/menu`
2. Instead of getting a 404, the server serves `index.html`  
3. React Router takes over and shows the menu page
4. âœ… Perfect user experience!

## Testing
1. Deploy your app with the new configuration
2. Scan the QR code from the admin panel
3. Should redirect to the menu without any 404 errors
4. Test direct URL access: `yoursite.com/menu`

## Need Help?
If you're still getting 404 errors:
1. Check which hosting platform you're using
2. Ensure the correct configuration file is in place
3. Clear your browser cache and try again
4. Contact your hosting provider for SPA routing support
